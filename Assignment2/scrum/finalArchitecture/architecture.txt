Name: Shape Strategy
Pattern Name: Strategy
Reference: https://www.oodesign.com/images/design_patterns/behavioral/strategy_implementation_-_uml_class_diagram.gif

Purpose:
	The Strategy pattern was implemented to align with the Open-Closed Principle.
    In our application, each Shape (e.g. Circle, Rectangle) responds to mouse actions.
    In particular, they respond to mouse clicks, drags, and releases to register that
    they are being drawn onto the canvas. However, every Shape responds to these mouse
    actions in different ways. For example, for a Circle, the first mouse click represents
    the center of the Circle being drawn. However, for a Rectangle, the first mouse click
    represents the top left corner of the Rectangle being drawn. Therefore, the Strategy pattern
    allows us to create different strategies for different shapes, so that they can respond to
    the user as needed. This approach ensures that our program is open for extension and
    closed for modification: We can create new shape strategies and allow the context to decide
    which one needs to be implemented (in this application, the context would be which shape button
    the user clicked), instead of modifying the current existing code to use a new strategy.
    As a result, this design keeps the application flexible and scalable.

UML:
	(UML will be made after we put things into folders).

Classes:
	ShapeStrategy: Strategy Interface
	CircleStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    OvalStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    PolylineStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    PrecisionEraserStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    RectangleStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    SelectionToolStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    SquareStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    SquiggleStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    TextStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
    TriangleStrategy: ConcreteStrategy
	StrategyFactory: Context

Usage:
	A developer would use this part of the code if they wanted to add a new shape
    strategy to the application. Firstly, they would need to create a new shape strategy
    that implements the ShapeStrategy interface. Then, they would need to ensure the context,
    which in our application is the StrategyFactory class, will use this new strategy
    when desired.
    (Note: How this last step is accomplished is discussed in the "Strategy Factory"
    section below).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name: Strategy Factory
Pattern Name: Factory
Reference: https://www.oodesign.com/images/stories/factory%20implementation.gif

Purpose:
    (Note: For more context behind what a strategy is in our application, please
    read the section "Shape Strategy" above).
	The Factory pattern was implemented to align with the Open-Closed Principle.
    In our application, the StrategyFactory is responsible for creating shape
    strategies (e.g., CircleStrategy, RectangleStrategy) based on which shape the
    user wants to draw. So, when the user clicks a button to choose a shape, that
    shape type is passed to the StrategyFactory, which then instantiates the correct
    shape strategy. This approach ensures that our program is open for extension and
    closed for modification: We can add new shape features by creating new shape strategies
    and updating the factory, instead of modifying the current existing code to support
    the new shape feature. As a result, this design keeps the application flexible and scalable.

Usage:
	A developer would use this part of the code if they wanted to add a new shape
    feature to the application. Firstly, they would need to create a new shape strategy
    that implements the ShapeStrategy interface. Then, they would need to update StrategyFactory
    to create this new strategy, by creating a new case corresponding to the shape's name
    (e.g. HexagonStrategy would have a case "hexagon").

Name: Shape Factory
Pattern Name: Factory
Reference: https://www.oodesign.com/images/stories/factory%20implementation.gif

Purpose:
    The Factory pattern was implemented to align with the Open-Closed Principle.
    In our application, the ShapeFactory is responsible for creating shape
    objects (e.g., Circle, Rectangle) based on which type the user desires.
    So, when the user clicks a button to choose a shape, that shape type is passed to
    the ShapeFactory, which then instantiates the correct shape object.
    This approach ensures that our program is open for extension and closed for modification:
    We can add new shape features by creating new shape classes and updating the factory,
    instead of modifying the current existing code to support the new shape feature.
    As a result, this design keeps the application flexible and scalable.

    that implements the Shape interface. Then, they would need to update ShapeFactory
    to create this new shape, by creating a new case corresponding to the shape's name
    (e.g. Hexagon would have a case "hexagon").
